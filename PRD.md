I want to create an android app to log hours frictionlessly. The data will be used to analyze my time spend pattens.
- inputs are: start time, end time, category, sub_category and descriptions
- category includes: self, routine, faith, work, family
- the date should be automatically filled by today's date
- I can use computer to simulate the app.
